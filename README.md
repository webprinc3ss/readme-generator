  ## Description
  The Readme-Generator is a Node.js app to assist developers on creating a userful README file via the terminal command-line.

  This application is created in Node.js with the Inquirer and fs.write modules.

  Inquirer is used to prompt questions for the user which is then written, using the fs.write module, to a template which prints out the README file.
